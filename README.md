NoteNest - The Note Taking App
1. Project Overview
NoteNest is a secure and user-friendly note-taking application that allows users to create, manage, and organize their personal notes efficiently. The backend is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, while the frontend is developed using React.js. The application ensures data security with JWT authentication, allowing only authorized users to manage their notes.
Description
The NoteNest App back-end is designed to offer users a reliable and secure environment for managing their personal notes. It features user authentication with JWT-based token security, ensuring that each user's data remains private and protected. The API enables users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their notes, allowing them to organize information effectively.
The backend is developed using Node.js and Express.js, leveraging MongoDB as the database to store user information and notes efficiently. Mongoose ODM is utilized to interact with MongoDB, simplifying data manipulation. Middleware such as express-validators used for request validation, while bcrypt ensures password encryption for secure authentication.
One of the core functionalities of the Notes App back-end is its authentication mechanism. Users must sign up and log in to access their notes. Each API request is validated using JWT authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can manage their data.
The Notes App back-end also includes error handling mechanisms to provide informative responses in case of invalid requests or server issues. This ensures a smooth user experience by preventing unauthorized access and handling common issues gracefully.
Designed to be modular and scalable, this back-end can be extended to include additional features such as note sharing, categorization, and reminders. It serves as an excellent foundation for developers who want to build a fully functional note-taking application.

2. Technology Stack
•	Frontend: React.js, Axios, CSS
•	Backend: Node.js, Express.js
•	Database: MongoDB with Mongoose ORM
•	Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and bcrypt for password hashing
•	Validation: Express-validator
•	API Testing: Postman

3. System Architecture
The application follows a client-server architecture, where:
•	Frontend (React.js) communicates with the backend API for user authentication and note management.
•	Backend (Express.js, MongoDB) handles business logic, user authentication, and CRUD operations for notes.
•	MongoDB is used as a NoSQL database to store user details and notes securely.
